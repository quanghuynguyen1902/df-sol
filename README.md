## Setting up the environment

To use package, you need to have Rust, nodejs, and git installed on your system. If you don't have them installed:
- Install rust from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/), 
- Install node.js >=18.0 from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
- Install git from [git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git)

Once these packages are installed, install `df-sol` package by run:

```sh
cargo install df-sol
```

## Creating a new project

To create a new project, you can use the following command:

```sh
df-sol init <name-project>
``` 
Example
```sh
df-sol init counter
```

To create a project using an optional template
```sh
df-sol init <name-project> --template <template>
``` 
Example
```sh
df-sol init counter-program --template counter
```
Program template includes:
- **basic**: Generate basic template
- **counter**:  Generate counter template
- **mint-token**:  Generate mint token template

Navigate to the folder you created and use Devbox to install the environment.
If you don't install, follow Follow the instruction from [the installation guide](https://www.jetify.com/devbox/docs/installing_devbox/).
Open a terminal in that folder.
- Init devbox 
  ```shell
  devbox init
  ```
- Start a new shell
  ```shell
  devbox shell --pure
  ```

## Writing and compiling smart contracts

### Writing smart contracts
Start by creating a new directory called `programs` and write logic smart contract to file `./src/lib.rs`.

### Compiling contracts
To compile the contract run `anchor build` in your terminal
```shell
 anchor build
```

## Testing contracts
A file test is generated for you. The shell of the test imports the `Anchor framework` files and gets the program ready to run. The tests to using the `mocha` test framework, so each `it` function defines a test and describe can be used to group tests together.
```typescript
import * as anchor from "@coral-xyz/anchor";
import { Program } from "@coral-xyz/anchor";
import { Counter } from "../target/types/counter";

describe("counter", () => {
  // Configure the client to use the local cluster.
  anchor.setProvider(anchor.AnchorProvider.env());

  const program = anchor.workspace.Counter as Program<Counter>;

  it("Is initialized!", async () => {
    // Add your test here.
    const tx = await program.methods.initialize().rpc();
    console.log("Your transaction signature", tx);
  });
});
```

To run test, use:
```shell
anchor test
```

## Deploying to a live network

Once you're ready to share your dApp with other people, you may want to deploy it to a live network. This way others can access an instance that's not running locally on your system.

The `mainnet` Solana network deals with real money, but there are separate `devnet` networks that do not.

To deploy to the `devnet` network, follow these steps:

1. **Configure Solana URL to Devnet**
    ```shell
    solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
    ```

2. **Airdrop SOL to Address**
  - To deploy a program to the `devnet` network, ensure that you have SOL in your wallet. The amount of SOL depends on the size of the program.

  - Get the address of the wallet:
    ```shell
    solana address --keypair wallet.json
    ```

  - Airdrop SOL to your address:
    ```shell
    solana airdrop 2 <address>
    ```

  - Check the balance of the address:
    ```shell
    solana balance <address>
    ```

3. **Deploy Program**
    ```sh
    anchor deploy
    ```

4. **Test Program**
    ```sh
    anchor test --skip-deploy
    ```

### Integrate with Frontend
Import the generated TypeScript module into your front-end application, and use it to interact with your program. The module provides functions that correspond to the functions defined in your IDL.

Copy `idl` of your program from `target/idl/{project_name}.json` to file `idl.json` in your front-end project folder. Then, following the code below:

```typescript
import { Program, AnchorProvider, setProvider } from "@project-serum/anchor";
import { Connection, KeyPair, PublicKey } from "@solana/web3.js";
import idl from "./idl.json";
import { Idl } from "@coral-xyz/anchor";
// where IDL is the .json created by anchor build

export const yourFunction = async () => {
    const wallet = KeyPair.generate();
    const connection = new Connection("https://api.devnet.solana.com");
    const provider = new AnchorProvider(connection, wallet, {});
    setProvider(provider);
    const programId = new PublicKey(idl.address);
    const program = new Program(idl as Idl, programId);
    // ... your code
    // e.g. await program.methods.yourMethod(YOUR_PARAMETERS).accounts({YOUR_ACCOUNTS}).rpc();
};
```
